# StockBot
This Python application monitors Tesla's stock prices in real-time and sends alerts via WhatsApp if significant changes occur. It also fetches the latest news related to Tesla, ensuring you're always up-to-date with market trends. This project is my first experience working with APIs, making it a great learning opportunity in integrating external services into Python applications.

## Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for logic and APIs.
Alpha Vantage API: Provides stock price data.
NewsAPI: Retrieves the latest news articles.
Twilio API: Sends WhatsApp notifications.
dotenv: Manages environment variables securely.
